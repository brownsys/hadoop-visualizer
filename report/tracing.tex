\section{Tracing}

Another section. This one will have a figure. See
Figure~\ref{fig:us-versus-them}. Each figure has a label, which must be
defined \emph{after} the caption. Traditionally, people use
\texttt{fig:...} for figure labels, \texttt{sec:...} for section
labels, and \texttt{tab:...} for table labels. For example, this is a
reference to Section~\ref{sec:intro}.
