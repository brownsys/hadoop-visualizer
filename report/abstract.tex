\subsection*{Abstract}

In this work we study the interaction of Data Intensive Scalable Computing (DISC) 
frameworks with the network they are executed in. Due to their distributed 
nature the network is a key component to DISC application's end-to-end 
performance, yet how these applications interact with the network is poorly 
understood. By applying rigorous analysis of the network behavior of DISC frameworks
we will be able to more clearly understand existing network and application 
bottlenecks as they relate to the end-to-end application performance. 

This work is a first step towards better understanding this interaction. We 
look specifically at the popular DISC framework Hadoop which is derived 
from Google's MapReduce framework. Through the combined use of low-level packet 
collection tools and high level application instrumentation we are able to 
correlate the performance of specific application behavior with its 
corresponding network behavior. We leverage this high and low level tracing to 
provide static and dynamic visualizations of the TCP flows created by Hadoop.
