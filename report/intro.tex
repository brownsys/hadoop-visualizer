\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
This is a simple example file on how to write a report using LaTeX.
Just use it as a base and replace the content. I put some examples of
commonly used features, but there are many more. Generally, you learn
these on demand. Examples include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Lists
\item Tables
\item Math text
\end{itemize}

After you write your LaTeX source, you have to compile it, run
BibTeX, and then compile twice again, to get all cross-references 
right. I also included a Makefile to make that whole process easier.
You just have to type \texttt{make} if you have your environment set.
It should work on Linux, MacOS, and cygwin. If you are running 
anything else, you should know how to set it up too.
