There has been some recent work by Weitzel on visualizing Hadoop related events in 
more dynamic ways. Particularly there has been two visualizations~\cite{HadoopViz1, HadoopViz2} that
have aimed to visualize data transfers of a Hadoop execution. This work however only looks at HDFS 
block related traffic and does not take into account job-specific or application-level details.
