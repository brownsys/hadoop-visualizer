There has been some recent work by Weitzel on visualizing Hadoop related events in 
more dynamic ways. Particularly there has been two visualizations~\cite{HadoopViz1, HadoopViz2} that
have aimed to visualize data transfers of a Hadoop execution. This work however only looks at HDFS 
block related traffic and does not take into account job-specific or application-level details. 
In addition, these visualizations do not account for general network traffic only the transfer
of HDFS blocks. For future work we would like to look at correlating TCP flows to specific HDFS block
transfers and especially correlating HDFS blocks to specific application-level behavior (e.g. is the 
block being read/write, is it mapper or reducer related, etc.).
